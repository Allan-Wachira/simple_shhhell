My partner and I developed a basic Unix shell completely from scratch. A shell is a user-friendly command-line interpreter, allowing users to interact with the operating system by typing specific commands. Our shell utilized a Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling users to execute predefined commands like 'rm' for file removal or 'cat' for merging word documents, among others. This method contrasts with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users navigate using a mouse; instead, in a CLI, users enter commands (e.g., 'ls' or 'rm') to display or modify files through a command line interface. While both GUI and CLI serve the same purpose of interfacing with the operating system, they differ in input methods. Some developers prefer CLI due to its faster typing efficiency compared to clicking and dragging in a GUI. Unix shells have evolved from the initial 'sh' (Ken Thompson's shell) to the widely used 'Bash' (Bourne Again Shell) today. Modern versions of shells exhibit improved memory management and enhanced functionality. Our shell is a simplified version that efficiently handles memory leaks while offering essential functions like folder creation, writing, reading, opening, and removal, terminal printing, directory navigation, and system location display.
